Setup
Clone the repository: 
First, you need to get the source code of the Amazon Scraper. You can do this by cloning the GitHub repository to your local computer. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
Copy code: git clone https://github.com/your_username/amazon_scraper.git
Make sure to replace your_username with your GitHub username.
Install dependencies:After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory using the terminal or command prompt:
Copy code
cd amazon_scraper
Next, you need to install the project dependencies. This can be done by executing the following command:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This command will install all the necessary Python libraries to run the script.
Execution
Run the script:Now that the dependencies are installed, you can run the Python script. In the terminal or command prompt, execute the following command:
Copy code
python amazon_scraper.py
Enter a keyword:The script will prompt you to enter a keyword related to the product you want to search for on Amazon. Type in the desired keyword and press Enter.
Wait for completion:The script will start scraping data for products matching the provided keyword on Amazon. Wait until the process is completed. Depending on the number of products and the speed of your internet connection, this may take a few seconds or minutes.
View the results:Once the scraping process is complete, the script will display the results on the screen. It will show the product title, rating, review count, and image URL for each scraped product.
Repeat (optional):If you want to search for different products, you can run the script again following the steps above.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the script execution, check if the dependencies are installed correctly and if you have a stable internet connection.
If the Amazon website blocks the requests, you can try again later or use a VPN service to bypass the block.
If errors occur during the script execution, check if the error messages provided give any clues about what went wrong and try to fix the issue based on them.
I hope these detailed instructions help you set up and run the Amazon Scraper smoothly!
